In the provided code, there are two versions of the `Item` component. Let's go through each of them and understand their differences.

First Version:

```jsx
export default class Item extends Component {
    val = {
        name: 'Rahul',
        roll: this.props.roll,
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <div className="name">Name is {this.val.name}</div>
                <div className="roll">Roll is {this.val.roll}</div>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

In this version, the `val` object is defined as a property of the `Item` class. It has two properties - `name` with a value of `'Rahul'`, and `roll` with a value of `this.props.roll`. However, `this.props.roll` does not seem to be defined within the component. Also, the `val` object is not part of the component's state.

Second Version:

```jsx
export default class Item extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = {
            name: this.props.name,
            roll: this.props.roll
        }
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <>
                <div className="name">MY name is {this.state.name}</div>
                <div className="roll">Roll is {this.state.roll}</div>
            </>
        )
    }
}
```

In this version, a constructor is used to initialize the component's state. The `name` property of the state is set to `this.props.name`, and the `roll` property of the state is set to `this.props.roll`. This assumes that the `name` and `roll` props are passed to the component correctly. The component then renders the `name` and `roll` properties from the state.

To summarize, the main difference between the two versions is how the data is stored and accessed. In the first version, the data is stored in the `val` object outside of the component's state. In the second version, the data is stored in the component's state. The second version is generally the recommended approach for managing component data and reactivity.
